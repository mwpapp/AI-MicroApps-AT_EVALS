    # Differential Considerations:
1. Text to Speech Software:
    a. Takes text as an input and reads it aloud.
    b. Helps students learn to pronounce words.
2. Speech to Text Software:
    a. Transcribes spoken words into text.
    b. Removes the stress of spelling and punctuation in writing.
3. Highlight each word as it is read:
    a. Provides visual and auditory modalities of information input.
4. Visual Aids:
    a. Diagrams and pictures that help explain concepts.
    b. Provide diagrams of verbal instructions.
5. Breaking down instructions
    a. Reduce multi-step instructions into single steps.
    b. Allow the student to complete a step before providing the next step.
6. Provide Extra Time
    a. Prodivde student with additional time to complete work

# Plan for Further Evaluation:
1. Predictive Assessment of Reading (PAR):
    a.  screening assessment that is used to identify how well a student is predicted to read and if that student will experience difficulty with a specific area of reading. Each of these aspects are covered: Phonemic Awareness, Vocabulary, Single Letter and Word reading, and Fluency.
2. Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS):
    a. standardized tests used to assess a student's fundamental reading skills, like phonemic awareness, letter recognition, and fluency, typically administered to children from kindergarten through 8th grade to identify potential literacy difficulties and monitor their progress over time; essentially, it's a quick way to gauge a child's basic reading abilities.
3. Texas Primary Reading Inventory (TPRI):
    a. one-on-one assessment to quickly assess students' early reading skills, helping teachers provide targeted instruction so that students improve as readers.
4. AIMSweb screening assessment:
    a. To assess Early Literacy, Reading, Early Numeracy, Mathematics, Spelling, and Writing.""",
