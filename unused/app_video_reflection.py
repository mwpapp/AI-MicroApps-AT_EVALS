APP_INTRO = """This app aims to demonstrate an AI-powered assessment that uses instructor guidance and AI support to encourage students to engage critically with an instructional video without first relying on AI.
1. First, a video is presented for the student to watch. Captions are burned in but not provided via full transcript. 
2. The student watches the video and answers an assessment. The questions, rubrics, and feedback guidance given to the AI are created by the educator.
3. Ideally, in this scenario the full transcript and any notes are shared with students after the assessment deadline has passed.
