                        ## Answer key: 

                        ### Important Issues: 
                        Tacky mucous membranes: they should be moist so this is a problem. 
                        Skin tent: this is a problem: skin tent is delayed, skin should be elastic and come back quickly into normal position after pinch. 
                        Lethargic: this is a problem
                        Abdominal palpation: this is normal
                        QAR (quiet, alert and responsive): Quietness can be a problem especially if Champ is normally excited –it can be another sign of lethargy 
                        Eye globes slightly retracted: this is a problem

                        ### Could be Important or Normal
                        Panting: this is not necessarily a problem, especially if rectal temperature is normal?

                        ### Normal (non-important) Factors
                        Pink mucous membranes: this is normal
                        Temperature: this is normal
                        CRT=2s : this is normal
                        Lungs auscultate clear on four quadrants bilaterally: this is normal
                        Strong, synchronous femoral pulse: this is normal
                        HR: this is normal.
