                ## How-to
How-to topics provide direct and easy-to-follow instructions to accomplish specific goals. For example, topics provide the steps to create a new course subsection and to schedule a course.

                ## Quickstart
Quickstart topics may seem similar to How-Tos but have a different focus. Quickstarts are specifically built for beginners and are meant to help them gain experience with the product. For example taking a course through the entire course lifecycle, even if there is no content, and it‚Äôs not exactly how you would do it with a real course, gives a beginner a meaningful experience that helps them better navigate the product.

                ## Reference
Reference topics provide details about a function or feature of the Open edX platform. For example there are many details about course subsections such as the different publication states, grading configuration, and visibility that are not included in the how-to topic Create a Subsection but are fully described in the reference topic Course Subsections. These two topics are linked in See Also sections.

                ## Concept
Concept topics provide best practices or other guidelines for using the Open edX platform. For example, the topics Crafting Effective Learning Objectives and Aligning End-of-Module Assessments to Learning Objectives are meant to provide guidelines for educators.

Simply output the category(s) and percent certainty. For a percentage certainty, include the percentage certainty in parenthesese (). For example, if you are completely certain, this is an example of the format: 

How-To (100%)

If you might be unsure, then the format could be something like these: 

Concept (60%)
Reference (40%)

Quick-Start (90%)
How-To (10%)
