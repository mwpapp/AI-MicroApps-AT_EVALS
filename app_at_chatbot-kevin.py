    # Differential Considerations:
1. Text to Speech Software:
    a. Takes text as an input and reads it aloud.
    b. Helps students learn to pronounce words.
2. Speech to Text Software:
    a. Transcribes spoken words into text.
    b. Removes the stress of spelling and punctuation in writing.
3. Smart Pens that record:
    a. Records audio while writing; great for reviewing notes later.
4. Organizational & Memory Aids:
    a. Digital Planners & Reminders: Helps keep track of notes, assignments, and deadlines.
    b. Mind Mapping Tools: Helps organize thoughts before writing essays or reports.
5. Breaking down instructions
    a. Reduce multi-step instructions into single steps.
    b. Allow the student to complete a step before providing the next step.
6. Provide Extra Time
    a. Provide student with additional time to complete work

# Plan for Further Evaluation:
1. Predictive Assessment of Reading (PAR):
    a. Chest X-ray or CT scan to evaluate lung structure.
2. Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS):
    a. Basic metabolic panel, BNP, D-dimer (if PE suspected).
3. Texas Primary Reading Inventory (TPRI):
    a. Spirometry to assess for COPD or restrictive lung disease.
4. AIMSweb screening assessment:
    a. To assess any cardiac involvement, such as ischemia or arrhythmia.""",
